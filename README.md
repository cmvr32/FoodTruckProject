## Food Truck Project

### Week 2 homework for Skill Distillery.

## Overview: Food Truck

Two weeks into Skill Distillery, our second homework assignment was to develop a program that allows the user to input information about up to 5 food trucks, then view the data in various ways. 

Assignment Guidelines:

Define a FoodTruck class with fields for a unique numeric id, a name, food type, and a numeric rating.Create a separate class with a main method that starts the program. It will have an array to store up to five FoodTruck objects. The main method of this class is the only static method in the entire project.

Automatically assign truck Id's in the FoodTruck constructor from a static field that is incremented as each truck is created. If the user inputs quit for the food truck name, input should end immediately and the program continues. After input is complete, the user sees a menu from which they can choose to: list all existing food trucks, see the average rating of food trucks, display the highest-rated food truck, and quit the program.

## Technologies/Skills Used

I started by creating a FoodTrucks class, identifying data to be collected for each new object created. Within the class I then populated the constructors, getters and setters. I finished the class with a toString which allowed me to print out object data within the App. 

Next I created the FoodTruckApp. I imported a scanner to collect user input. Created a static main method where I instantiated a food truck array set to 5 allowing the user to create up to 5 unique food truck objects. The food truck app collects user input to build new trucks storing the information within each foodtruck[i] object within the array. Once the data has been collected the user is presented with a menu allowing them to chose from several functions. Each function was built out in a method and called to print within a while loop and a switch.

## Lessons Learned

This project shed light on how basic my understanding is of the new topics learned and how incredibly beneficial hands on projects like these are to help deepen my understanding of them!

Personally I learned the importance of hands on learning! I learned how to build a skeleton framework and to work step by step through each section narrowing down my areas of confusions then present specific questions to the TA's for help. 

Technically I learned more about creating classes that allow objects to be built and stored within arrays. I feel more comfortable with methods, when and how to use them. I also learned through lot's trial and error about calling classes and using getters and setters to present stored data on objects stored in arrays.
